But there's more to it ! You can also customize the url to the json that lists the videos, which means you can use this plugin to provide Projectivy any video list you want (trailers, live cams...).
Feel free to share your custom lists !

# Usage
- Install the plugin to an Android Tv device with Projectivy Launcher installed
- Go to Projectivy settings > Appearance > Wallpaper and choose "Overflight" in the dropdown list
